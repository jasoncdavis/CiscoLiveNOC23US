# SSH2Influx work definition file based on YAML 1.1 spec
# https://yaml.org/spec/1.1/
# Define the hosts to be polled under an [inventory][hosts] branch.
# Hosts can have specific commands with a subordinate commands list;
# [inventory][vars][globalcommands] will be used for all entries


# Example of inventory with a host-specific set of commands and
# one host that only has globalcommands
# [note: both get global commands]
#
# inventory:
#  hosts:
#    - host: device-1
#      commands:
#        - cmd: show ver
#          parsespec: 1001
#        - cmd: show clock
#          parsespec: 1002
#    - host: device-2
